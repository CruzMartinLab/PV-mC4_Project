%% Full mEPSC Analysis 

% READ!!!!!!!

%must adhere strictly to the file organization as given in the sample_data
%naming strucutre must also be consistent: default of clampex:
%YYYY_MM_DD_xxxx_filtered.abf
%YYYY = year of recording
%MM = month of recording
%DD = day of recording
%xxxx = number recotding that day (e.g. 3rd recording of a day is 0003,
%fifteenth recording is 0015, etc)
%filtered: ALL of my recordings I filter in clampfit, specifically I use a
%boxcar with 7 smoothing points. this is important because all the
%accurately marking events are based on this filtering. please ask
%questions if you cannot figure this out. in clampex, open file and then
%hit analyze->filter->select boxcar and select 7 smoothing points and
%ensure you filter the entire trace

%As presently constructed, this code will analyze the sample data for
%parvalbumin positive interneurons - also available is sample data for
%pyramidal neurons. To run this, you will need to switch the paths to grab
%the PYR files (organized the same as the PV-INs, see 'sample_data' folder)
%AND switch the analysis function to find_EPSCs_PYR.

%for each cell, I record 2-5 minutes of gap-free recordings, 1 minute each
